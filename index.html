<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document. -->
<!-- It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element: -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Index Page</title>
  </head>

  <!-- The <body> element defines the document's body. -->
  <!-- It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>. -->
  <!-- Then, inside the <body> element are every other elements either empty, closed,
    selfclosing or complete elements. -->
  <!-- combinations of keybord characters that form a start tag, 
  contents within and an end tag is refered to as html elements. 
  Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag,  Never Skip the End Tag.

  some tags do not have a close tag, neither do they have contents within so they are therefore refered to as 
  self closing, empty tags or empty elements. 
  examples include:  
 1. The <br> tag - it defines a line break.

<!-- HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
  but lowercase is preferable and demanded for stricter document types like XHTML.-->

  HTML Attributes
  a. HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
  b. All HTML elements can have attributes.
  c. Attributes provide additional information about elements.
  d. Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
  e. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
  examples include
  1. The href Attribute - used with <a> (anchor tag) specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
  2. The src Attribute - used with <img> (image tag)  specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
     There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
        i. Absolute URL - This links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
        Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
        Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, 
        you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; 
        it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        ii. Relative URL - This links to an image that is hosted within the website. 
        Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
        If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
        If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
      Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain. 
  3. The width and height Attributes - The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, 
     which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels):
    -->

  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My paragraph.</p>

    <h2>My Second Heading</h2>
    <p>My paragraph.</p>
    <img src="goody'sImages/image1.jpg" alt="picture perfect" width="" height="">
    <img src="goody'sImages/image2.jpg" alt="picture perfect" width="500" height="600">

    <!-- Some elements without content -->
    <!-- also known as empty or self closing tags -->
  
    <h3>My Third Heading</h3>
    <h4>My Forth Heading</h4>
    <h5>My Fifth Heading</h5>
    <h6>My Sixth Heading</h6>
    <p>My paragraph.</p>
    <a href="page1.html">This is a link</a>
    <br />
    <a href="page2.html">This is a link</a>
  </body>
</html>
